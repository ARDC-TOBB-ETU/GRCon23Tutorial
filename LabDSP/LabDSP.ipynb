    "## GNU Radio\n",
    "GNU Radio is software radio toolkit that is free and open-source (**FOSS**). It has many DSP blocks which are mostly written in **C++**. You can also write blocks in **Python** though their execution will be slower. GNU Radio also has a built-in **scheduler** to provide blocks with data thay need. Data flow is handled by scheduler. Each block has a specific function.\n",
    "\n",
    "GNU Radio has no GUI but it comes with an application called **GNURadio Companion (GRC)** so you can add and connect blocks together to build what is called a **flowgraph**. You can find a block by searching from available blocks. After you find your block you can add blocks either by double clicking on it or dragging and dropping it onto the surface of GRC. You can also connect blocks in a Python scrit if you wish. Actually this is what GRC does! It generates a script file to do all connections and start the flowgraph. Every flowgraph starts with a **source** block and terminates with a **sink** block. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Task1: Characterizing a real bandpass filter\n",
    "Below is the first flowgraph we will create. In this example we will examine filter characteristics of a bandpass filter. Filters are fundamental building blocks of DSP. Our flowgraph has one source and two sink blocks. We feed the flowgraph with a **noise source** in order to see filter's spectral characteristics and we use sink blocks to display the resulting spectrum and to hear the sound. Try to change the filter properties and see the effects of change of the filter. \n",
